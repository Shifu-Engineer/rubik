# rubik

A set of very useful tools for data wrangling and processing that could be used with the Python library Pandas. This tools allows the user to give to a Pandas DataFrame any kind of complex structured, being able to arrange columns and rows as if they were part of a Rubik's cube.

## Test and use rubik

```
import rubik as rk
import pandas as pd
```

## Available Functions:

This is a list of the functions with very simple examples for it use.

### 0. The header

```
import pandas as pd
from operator import itemgetter
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 20)
```

After the Pandas Version 0.23, the used must explicitly specify the number of columns that will be printed in the standard output. When Pandas library is loaded the `set_option` method set the default to 20.

### 1. **changeNaNforEmptyList** function

`changeNaNforEmptyList(data_frame, column_name)`

From any column in a DataFrame, replace the NaN values with empty lists.

#### 1.1 Arguments:

```
data_frame  - The DataFrame we are going to work with.

column_name - A String with the column name we are going to modify.
```

#### 1.2 Example:

The **original table** is:

| Entry | Id        | Roles     |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 0     | user-123  | NaN       |
| 1     | user-452  | [1]       |
| 2     | user-21   | [5, 2]    |
| 3     | user-621  | NaN       |
| 4     | user-5512 | [3,4]     |
| 5     | user-25   | [1, 2, 3] |

The **new table** is:

| Entry | Id        | Roles     |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 0     | user-123  | [ ]       |
| 1     | user-452  | [1]       |
| 2     | user-21   | [5, 2]    |
| 3     | user-621  | [ ]       |
| 4     | user-5512 | [3,4]     |
| 5     | user-25   | [1, 2, 3] |

- version - 1.3.1. *'Just a little bit higher, not too much.'*

    1. Standardizing names and the format.

- version 1.3 *'I should not be high in classes.'*
        
    1. Improvements in the flatDict.
            Avoid crashing names with the dictionary keys.
    2. Adding the chunkify function.

- version 0 *I am not the original one, but I'm old, thought.*
